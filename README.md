Final Project : (Asklepios) E-Commerce Shipping Data 

## Project Background
The E-Commerce Shipping Dataset shows that from 10,999 samples of online purchase transactions, 59.74% of transactions are still experiencing
delay in delivery of goods.

Based on the journal published by ANTARRA, timeliness of delivery has a 50.1% effect on customer satisfaction. Customers will
get a bad experience in using the company's E-Commerce services.

In addition, this delay has also caused the company to experience potential revenue loss from a financial and operational perspective
projects. On the financial side, this delay creates lead times when billing invoices.

While on the operational side of the project, delays make the project not run smoothly and slow down the processing time so that
lead to higher warehouse rental costs. (Journal of Business Logistics)

Asklepios as an independent data science consultant company, was hired to process a dataset shipment. We
asked to find solutions on how to overcome the problems they have through the dataset.

3. Open Jupyter Labs on Anaconda Navigator / Open file .ipynb on Visual Studio Code
4. Open Terminal and Update All Python Package 

    On Linux     : pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U <br>
    On Windows   : pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}
